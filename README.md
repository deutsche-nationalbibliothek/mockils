# MockILS

This is just meant for development and testing, not for production.

A fastapi implementation to mock parts of the aras API to test aras-py and to perform some item queries in context of the webarchive.


You need to create a directory `data` with the following abstract structure:

```
data:
- repositoryA
  - idn1
    - fileX.txt
    - fileY.gz
  - idn2
  - â€¦
- repositoryB
```
